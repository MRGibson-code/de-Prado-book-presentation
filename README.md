Chapter 5 of Machine Learning for Asset Managers


This is part of a presentation for Marcos Lopez de Prado's book, Machine Learning for Asset Managers.
My friend Ali Abedi and I performed a presentation for 5th chater, Fiancial Labeling.
Here, you can find the slides of the presentation in a pdf file, along with the Python implementation of this chapter on AAPL stock prices.
